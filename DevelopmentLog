There was some difficulties, for example, the comunication between the backend and the front end, to recharge the page with the new information.
Also to recieve the file, because the server has some issues when it is running in windows, the file's path was not correct, and wh lost a lot of time in this part until we tried
in Santiago's computer that has Linux. So this is an special requirment that we need, because this might get some problems if you run it in windows.
This issue also make us useless for testing, so we have to connect a lot of times with Santiago so he can test it. 
On the other hand, we have never worked together, so we have seen that we make a goos team:)

We didn't achieve to finish the project because we fail to load the json in the js code.
